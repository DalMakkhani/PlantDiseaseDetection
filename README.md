The .ipynb file has everything that you will need to implement this project. 
Make sure to get your Kaggle token before you start excecuting this project. You can get it from the profile section in your Kaggle account.
Here is the dataset that we have used -----> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

The given CNN model has the following Layers: 
    2 Convolutional Layers for feature extraction
    2 MaxPooling Layers for dimensionality reduction
    1 Fully Connected Layer for classification

This model is to be integrated with an app, whose GUI can be found in SafalFasal repo.
